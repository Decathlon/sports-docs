# F.A.Q.

## How were the sports chosen?

These sports were humanly curated by Decathlon staff with data from 40+ years of
field expertise.

We do plan on expanding research on this data with the help of our community, so application developers and/or data
researchers can get the most out of it.

## How is it supposed to help me?

The data provided here is a result of countless hours of research and our goal is to
make it easy for Sport Tech startups to get ahead by quickly having access to metrics
such as popularity, density, weather-based recommendations etc...

## What if a sport is missing?

Our team has worked really hard to put together an inclusive list of sports, but
we know that sport modalities can differ wildly from country to country.
If you can't find info about a specific sport using our API, please don't
hesitate in contacting us at
[developers@decathlon.com](mailto:developers@decathlon.com)

*** Sports can be searched using the `q` parameter. E.g.: https://sports-decathlon.herokuapp.com/sports?q=soccer**

## Where can I see/download the list of sports in a readable format?

As of the time of this writing, we only support JSON, but we're open to other
formats as well. Please [let us know](mailto:developers@decathlon.com) if your
application requires a different format.
