# Introduction

The Decathlon Sports API can be used by any developer worldwide to obtain details of what sports can be practiced.
This data is primarily sourced from Decathlon's global network of sport experts.

An API key is only required when modifying data - something we plan to restrict to Decathlon employees only. No key is
needed to read data.
