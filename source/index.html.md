# Introduction

The Decathlon Partners API can be used by any developer worldwide to obtain details of communities where 
certain sports can be practiced. This data is primarily sourced from Decathlon's global network of sport experts.

Currently this API is for **INTERNAL USE ONLY** until we've fully completed our authorization controls in conjunction
with the Decathlon Connect team in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.

An API key is only required when modifying data - something we plan to restrict to Decathlon employees only. No key is
needed to read data.
