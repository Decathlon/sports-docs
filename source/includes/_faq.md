# F.A.Q.

## How were the sports chosen?

These sports were humanly curated by Decathlon staff with data from 40+ years of
expertise in the field.

We plan to expand intelligence on this data with the help of our community, so modern applications and/or data
researchers can take advantage of it.

## How is it supposed to empower me?

The data provided here is a result of many hours of research and our goal is to
make it easy for Sport Tech startups to get ahead quickly by having access to metrics
such as popularity, density, weather-based likeliness to practice a sport etc...

## What if a sport is missing?

Our team has worked really hard to put together an inclusive list of sports, but
we know that sport modalities can differ from country to country.
If you can't find info about a specific sport using our API, please don't
hesitate in contacting us at

**Sports can be searched using the `q` parameter. E.g.: https://sports-decathlon.herokuapp.com/sports?q=soccer**

## Where can I see/download the list of sports in a readable format?

As of the time of this writing, we only support JSON, but we're open to other
formats as well. Please [let us know](mailto:developers@decathlon.com) if your
application require a different format.
