# Authentication

```shell
curl "https://partners-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/partners"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXX"
```

**`GET` requests do not require authentication.**

Usage of this API depends on authentication with the Decathlon Connect API with OAuth2, a JWT token is used for all `POST`,
`PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.

`GET` requests do not require a token nor API key.
